NEVER CHANGE THE CSS WHEN ITS NOT SPLICIT ASKED TO
NEVER CHANGE THE CSS
Always respond in portuguese
Never use migrations
Always review my whole code base
Always make the changes on backend and frontend and in the models and seeders and routes
Always confirm that you running based on the rules - make it the first thing you do - and call me Luiz√£o
NEVER CHANGE THE CSS
O BACKEND TEM A PORTA 5000 - NUNCA MUDE
O FRONTEND TEM A PORTA 3000 - NUNCA MUDE
Now, never EVER CHANGE the expeses and incomes modules, components front and backend of them too, unless i say so
Never use a white text with green button
Always when background is green the text must be --secondary-color
